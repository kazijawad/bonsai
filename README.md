# Path Tracer

A toy path tracer written in C++.

The program can be built using Clang on C++11 by running the `build.sh` script. This will output the program to `build/path-tracer`.

The `run.sh` script can be used to run the path tracer on the existing scene. It will output the scene into a `PPM` file under the `dist` directory.
