# Path Tracer

A toy path tracer based on [Ray Tracing In One Weekened](https://raytracing.github.io).

The program can be built using Clang on C++11 by running the `build.sh` script. This will output the program to `bin/path-tracer`.

To run the built path tracer on the existing scene, the `run.sh` script can be used.
